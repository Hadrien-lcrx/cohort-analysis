# Cohort analysis
### Real-world applications of cohort analysis

This repository contains the code for the free online course on [cyborgus.com](https://www.cyborgus.com). The course covers practical aspects of cohort analysis with Python, and is aimed at teach how to use them to analyze business.

This course will teach students how to practically implement cohort analysis on an online retail dataset from the
University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository which can be accessed [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail) or is already available in this repository.

The course uses the cohort analysis classification proposed by the Corporate Finance Institute (see reference no. 3).

The main parts of the course are:
1. **Data cleaning and exploration** – In this section we will explore the dataset and clean it to prepare for the analysis - remove NULL values, and filter out data that are not relevant for this project.
2. **Building time-based cohorts** – Build cohorts based on customer acquisition time.
3. **Calculating retention rate** – Calculate basic retention metric and build a heatmap visualization.
4. **Building segment-based cohorts** – Build cohorts based on customer behavior on the first month e.g. purchased product X.
5. **Building size-based cohorts** – Build cohorts based on the amount of customer purchases e.g. assign quartiles to customer based on the Total amount spent in the first month.
6. **Calculate metrics for cohorts** – After the cohorts are assigned, this section will show how to calculate and analyze metrics for each of the cohorts such as retention, average spend, frequency, lifetime value and other.
7. **Visualize cohorts and metrics** – Students will learn how to build heatmaps and charts to visualize cohorts and their metrics, and how to interpret them.
